# Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

## 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

## 3. Create and Setup a Virtual Environment

Next, create a virtual environment and install

```
make setup
```bash

## 4. Run the Application

Finally, you can run the application. Use the following command:

```
make run
```bash

This will activate the virtual environment and start the application with hot reloading enabled, so the server will automatically update whenever you make changes to your code.

That's it! You've now set up and started the application.
